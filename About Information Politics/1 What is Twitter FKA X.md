# What is Twitter/X?

Twitter was initial founded in 2006 by Jack Dorsey as a platform to broadcast post brief status updates; the platform was intended as a casual social media platform for users to share personal updates between friends.

From around 2007 onwards, Twitter explodes in popularity, with the platform becoming dominated by popular trends and large influencers, marking a shift from its original purpose. Hashtags were a popular method to categorize tweets. Retweets quote tweets, and @ mentions were used to continue discussions and directly interact with other users.

With help from these tools, Twitter increasingly became used as a news source, as well as a platform for people to post their immediate reactions to concurrent events and form discussions around them. In 2009, actor Ashton Kutcher and the news source CNN the two largest users, becoming the first two accounts with over one million followers. During the same year, the verification checkmark was introduced to differentiate authentic accounts of infleuntial figures from imposters, signifying increased use of the platform for information and by famous people.

## How is Twitter relevant to information politics? Why should it be considered an influential platform?
Throughout the 2010s, Twitter was increasingly used to fascilitate social movements. The 2017 #MeToo movement was an instance of this usecase. Sparked by female celebrities publicizing their stories of sexual harassment and assault, many public figures encouraged others to come forward with their own stories. In doing so, many hoped to open a dialogue on issues surrounding consent and power dynamics. Twitter was the main platform used to spread and discuss @MeToo, sparking widespready HR policy changes in the workplace.

Twitter also become controversial for the spread of information and harassment, with some suggesting insufficient content moderation. For instance, many criticized the #MeToo movement for encourage false accusations without also emphasizing the importance of due process. Some credit Twitter with the rise of "cancel culture," a term given to the increasing popularity of deplatforming public figures who are accused of crimes or offensive behavior. Meanwhile, others criticise Twitter for failing to curb conspiracy theories, such as the ones surrounding the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting.

Eventually, approaching 2020, Twitter began to more aggressively crack down on misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic and election cycle. Some, including Elon Musk, believed that this crackdown was heavily biased towards left-leaning politics; critics took issue with the ban on Donald Trump's twitter account following the 2021 United States Capital insurrection.

Twitter's history is marred in controversy over misinformation and conspiracy, but ultimately its popularity has never dropped significantly throughout its lifespan. Therefore, it is worth studying the imapct of Twitter and its changing policies.

## Twitter/X under Musk
Twitter was acquired by Elon Musk in early 2022, with the handover completed on October 22, 2022. Its algorithms and censorship policies have changed drastically during this time period.

The purpose of the project is not  to evaluate Musk's support for freedom of speech on Twitter, nor is it to accuse him of being a biased or partisan as a leader of the platform; it is moreso to monitor the real impact of his purchase of the platform on adjacent information sites. However, his political affiliations are relevant, as he is now one of the most prominent voices on the platform, as well as a major influence on the algorithm of the platform. 

Under his leadership, the transparancy of the Twitter algorithm has changed, decreasing in some ways. He has publicized documents regarding censorship of the platform before his takeover. However, he has not fully open-sourced the platform, keeping his changes to the approach of censorship private. He has also paywalled the API, making it difficult to study information traffic on a large scale. A public change included the boost of verified accounts; under Musk, verified accounts are no longer given to public figures, but instead can be purchased for a monthly subscription. This has the effect of biasing promotion of tweets towards users who would purchase verification. For instance, users who support Musk's takeover would be expected to be more likely to purchase verification.

Musk has introduced community notes to attempt to curb misinformation. Additionally, he has introduced an in-platform AI called Grok, which is developed under his company XAI. Some accuse Musk of biasing the AI as well; he has shown willingness in the past to tweak Grok, citing the spread of misinformation; this is a case of disagreement on information occuring on the platform, a major aspect of the trend this project aims to study.
