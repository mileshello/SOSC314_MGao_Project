## Who is Elon Musk (in relation to this research project)
Elon Musk is a South African born entrepeneur living in the United States of America. Companies he currently leads include SpaceX, Tesla, and now X. Most of his companies include some focus on technological advancement, though they are also generally commercial.

Musk began showing support for the Republican party in the United States in 2022, the same year he acquired Twitter. His public reasoning for the acquisition was the support of the freedom of speech, as well as the pursuit of true information. He has since become very active politically, both on and off of the Twitter platform; he has appeared at political rallies in support of Donald Trump and other local republican political candidates.


## Musk's Comments on Wikipedia
In addition to the takeover influencing public discourse, Musk has directly critiqued Wikipedia as a platform, citing bias and censorship. Below are quotations and links to his comments on the platform.

Before the takeover:

"They say history is written by the victors, but not on Wikipedia if the losing party is still alive & has lots of time on their hands!" April 21, 2022, https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1517055957209071617

"Wikipedia is losing its objectivity @jimmy_wales" July 29, 2022, https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1553031114838745089

After the takeover:

"Most of Earth: 'The MSM is biased.' Wikipedia: 'Cite MSM source to confirm this claim.' 🤣🤣 Wikipedia has a non-trivial left-wing bias. @jimmy_wales, what are your thoughts?" Dec 6, 2022, https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1600200000763756544.

"A two day suspension of maybe 7 accounts for doxxing got an actual Wikipedia page!? Wikipedia is controlled by the MSM journalists. Can’t trust that site anymore." Dec 17 2022, https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1604195049469710336.

"Wikipedia is overly controlled by mainstream media @jimmy_wales" Dec 17, 2022, https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1604204799209402368.

His direct call-outs are likely to impact the public perception of Wikipedia, as well as encourage attempts to edit the cite, particularly in support of the viewpoints which Musk claims are suppressed. With these preliminary conditions, the research question was crafted, aimed specifically at evaluating Musk's personal influence discourse off-platform.
