Guiding Research Question: Does the acquisition of Twitter/X by Elon Musk correlate with a shift in activity level and accepted coverage of controversial or political wikipedia articles?

The purpose for asking this question is to evaluate the impact of the acquisition on a wider scale than on the platform itself. From experience, the content on the platform appears to have changed, and Musk and his team have openly discussed changes to the algorithm, including purchasable verification and reduced censorship which may have played a role in the noticeable shifts. Furthermore, the acquisition coincided with the voter shift between the 2020 and 2024 United States elections. However, given the extended time period between the acquisition in 2022 and the 2024 election, as well as the wide variety of other potential factors, it may be useful to examine intermediate causes-and-effects between the acquisition and political influence. More specifically, a more granular time scale, as well as specific topics are important to understanding this correlation. Wikipedia is not under control of Musk, but it can be edited by any user on the internet; also, while intended as a source of pure information, it does reflect upon user biases of the time period. Therefore, Wikipedia is a strong candidate for a case study on the impact of Twitter/X’s shift on an adjacent platform.

Specifically, the project aims to examine the change in the activity level of specific topics, as well as the specific language used in the articles. The units of analysis will therefore be edit volume (edits/month), unique editors per period, revert rates, and word frequency. The purpose of the edit-based variables is to determine how active the site is, and the purpose of the word frequency is to detect possible shifts in acceptable language and rhetoric on the articles. 

To obtain the information, the intended method is the API MediaWiki, which contains important data, such as the text in each revision (including added and removed words) and the date of each revision (as well as the number of revisions in a given time period).

The articles must be carefully selected: articles should not be directly involved in the acquisition, as activity would increase due to coverage of new events (examples would include Elon Musk, who is directly involved, or Donald Trump, whose account was reinstated following the acquisition) which is irrelevant to the purpose of the project; such articles would bias the data in favor of X as an influential platform. From the preliminary exploration, the project will be focused on data from closely approaching October 2022 and around January - June of 2023. As the articles require individual research, the project seeks to examine around 10 topics, with 1-3 articles for each topic.

An example article with a shift around the target time period discusses transgender rights: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Legal_status_of_transgender_people&action=history. The following figure contains data about editing volume.

While the figure is a strong example, it does not inform decision making, as it is a small sample size, and the purpose of the initial exploration is to demonstrate feasibility in obtaining data and observing patterns.
